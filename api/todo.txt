DONE remove unnecessary error checking

"encryptedPassword" into  "ctx.state"  to pass the "password"
password verification should be done inside validators
ID => Id
getUsers => getAllUsers
prevent results to get duplicated
hide password from students (findOne field)
Student = student
final code optimize
