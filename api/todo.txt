_id:uuid
destructuring
validator array[v1,v2,v3,v4,v5,v6,v7]
fields validation baaki

encryptedPassword ctx.state to pass password
lowercase Student
remove snake_case
password verification should be done inside validators
proper destructuring 
ID => Id
remove unnecessary error checking
getUsers => getAllUsers
prevent results to get duplicated
hide password from students (findOne field)
Student = student
final code optimize 




Doubt
whether to put (const {} = something) after try{} ?
